## Hello, mate!
Regardless of how you got here, I will try to introduce myself to you.

### Public Information

My name is Eduardo Oliveira, I currently live in Brazil, Goiás and I'm studying System Analysis and Development (ADS) at ULBRA university.

I first had contact with programming when I was 15 with **Python**, but started to study for real when I was 16 years old, focusing on Javascript. Nowadays I decided to focus on specializing myself in Back-end development with Nodejs and Express.

In my free time I like to do a lot of different things, depending on what I'm feeling like doing. But mostly, I enjoy spending my time reading, watching tv shows and also working on personal projects.
